# Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app solution

This is a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db).
This is a simple challenge to build out an advice generator that gives users a new piece of advice every time they click the green random cube button. I chose this challenge to help learn how to interact with a third party API and practice basic HTML and CSS.

## My process

1. Create static design with only HTML & CSS, hardcoding all the data for one quote
2. Using the fetch() web api to set up functionality for generating random advice
3. Create hover states and make design responsive to different screen sizes

### Built with

- Basic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- How to work with asynchronous javascript & use of callbacks and promises, how to use fetch() to make an api call, async/await
- Techniques of how to center things in css, although still a pain
- Basics of responsive web design, relative css units, media queries

### Continued development

- Continue building projects using external apis, since this one was a simple introduction
- Learn more responsive design techniques
- Practive writing asynchronous javascript and working with promises
